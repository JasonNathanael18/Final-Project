                     <h4>BIOGRAPHY</h4>
                     <P>Ryan Giggs closed is a Welsh football coach and former player. He is the manager of the Wales
                        national team and a co-owner of Salford City. He played his entire professional career for
                        Manchester United, and briefly served as Manchester United's interim manager.

                           <br><br>
                           The son of rugby union, and Wales international rugby league footballer Danny Wilson, Giggs
                           was
                           born in Cardiff but moved to Manchester at the age of six when his father joined Swinton
                           RLFC.
                           Predominantly a left winger, he began his career with Manchester City, but joined Manchester
                           United on his 14th birthday in 1987. He made his professional debut for the club in 1991 and
                           spent the next 23 years in the Manchester United first team. At the end of the 2013–14
                           season,
                           he was named as Manchester United's interim player-manager following the sacking of David
                           Moyes.
                           He was named as assistant manager under Moyes' permanent replacement, Louis van Gaal, on 19
                           May
                           2014; he retired from playing the same day. He holds the club record for competitive
                           appearances. At international level, Giggs played for the Wales national team 64 times
                           between
                           1991 and 2007, and was named as the captain of the Great Britain team that competed at the
                           2012
                           Summer Olympics. He is one of only 28 players to have made over 1,000 career appearances.
                           <br><br>
                           Giggs is the most decorated player in football history. During his time at United, he won 13
                           Premier League winner's medals, four FA Cup winner's medals, three League Cup winner's
                           medals,
                           two UEFA Champions League winner's medals, a FIFA Club World Cup winners medal, an
                           Intercontinental Cup winner's medal, a UEFA Super Cup winner's medal and nine FA Community
                           Shield winner's medals. Manchester United and Liverpool are the only clubs in English
                           football
                           history to have won more league championships than Giggs. Giggs captained United on numerous
                           occasions, particularly in the 2007–08 season when regular captain Gary Neville was ruled out
                           with various injuries.
                           <br><br>
                           Giggs also has a number of personal achievements. He was the first player in history to win
                           two
                           consecutive PFA Young Player of the Year awards (1992 and 1993), though he did not win the
                           PFA
                           Player of the Year award until 2009. He was the only player to play in each of the first 22
                           seasons of the Premier League, as well as the only player to score in each of the first 21
                           seasons. He was elected into the PFA Team of the Century in 2007, the Premier League Team of
                           the
                           Decade in 2003, as well as the FA Cup Team of the Century. Giggs holds the record for the
                           most
                           assists in Premier League history, with 271. He was named as BBC Sports Personality of the
                           Year
                           in 2009. In addition to the many honours Giggs has received within football, he was appointed
                           an
                           OBE in the Queen's 2007 Birthday Honours List for his services to football.

                     <P>
                        Bobby Charlton is an English former footballer who played as a forward. He is regarded as one of
                        the
                        greatest players of all time, and was a member of the England team that won the 1966 FIFA
                        World Cup, the year he also won the Ballon d'Or. He played almost all of his club football at
                        Manchester United, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts, his passing abilities
                        from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot, as well as his fitness and stamina. He was
                        cautioned only twice in his career; once against Argentina in the 1966 World Cup, and once in a
                        league match against Chelsea. His elder brother Jack, who was also in the World Cup-winning
                        team, is a former defender for Leeds United and international manager.

                           <br><br>
                           Born in Ashington, Northumberland, Charlton made his debut for the Manchester United
                           first-team
                           in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time
                           he
                           survived the Munich air disaster of 1958 after being rescued by Harry Gregg. After helping
                           United to win the Football League First Division in 1965, he won another First Division title
                           with United in 1967. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the European
                           Cup,
                           scoring two goals in the final to help them become the first English club to win the
                           competition. He is United's second all-time leading goal scorer (249), being surpassed by
                           Wayne
                           Rooney, and held the distinction of being England's all-time top goal scorer (49) from May
                           1968
                           to September 2015, when again Rooney surpassed his record. Charlton held the record for most
                           appearances for Manchester United (758), before being surpassed by Ryan Giggs in the 2008
                           UEFA
                           Champions League Final.
                           <br><br>
                           He was named in the England squad for four World Cups (1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970), though did
                           not play in the first. At the time of his retirement from the England team in 1970, he was
                           the
                           nation's most capped player, having turned out 106 times at the highest level. This record
                           has
                           since been surpassed by Bobby Moore and Peter Shilton.
                           <br><br>
                           He left Manchester United to become manager of Preston North End for the 1973–74 season. He
                           changed to player-manager the following season. He next accepted a post as a director with
                           Wigan
                           Athletic, then became a member of Manchester United's board of directors in 1984 and remains
                           one as of the 2018–19 season.

                     <P>
                        Roy Keane is an Irish football manager and former professional football player who is the
                        assistant manager at Nottingham Forest under Martin O'Neill. He is the joint-most successful
                        Irish footballer of all time, having won 19 major trophies, 17 of which came at Manchester
                        United, in his club career. He served as the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland
                        national team from 2013 until 2018.

                           <br><br>
                           In his 18-year playing career, Keane played for Cobh Ramblers, Nottingham Forest and
                           Manchester
                           United, before ending his career at Celtic. Keane was a dominating box-to-box midfielder,
                           noted
                           for his aggressive and highly competitive style of play, an attitude that helped him excel as
                           captain of Manchester United from 1997 until his departure in 2005. Keane helped United
                           achieve
                           a sustained period of success during his 12 years at the club. He then signed for Celtic, but
                           retired as a player less than a year later.
                           <br><br>
                           Keane played at international level for the Republic of Ireland over a period of 14 years,
                           most
                           of which he spent as captain. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he played in every Republic of
                           Ireland
                           game. He was sent home from the 2002 World Cup after a dispute with national coach Mick
                           McCarthy
                           over the team's training facilities.
                           <br><br>
                           Regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, in 2004 Keane was named by Pelé in
                           the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. In 2007, The Times placed him at
                           number 11 in their list of the 50 "hardest" footballers in history.
                           <br><br>
                           Keane was appointed manager of Sunderland shortly after his retirement as a player and took
                           the
                           club from 23rd position in the Football League Championship, in late August, to win the
                           division
                           title and gain promotion to the Premier League. He resigned in December 2008, and from
                           April 2009 to January 2011, he was manager of Championship club Ipswich Town. In November
                           2013, he was appointed assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team by manager
                           Martin O'Neill. Keane has also worked as a studio analyst for British channel ITV's football
                           coverage.

                     <P>
                        Paul Scholes is an English football coach and former
                        player. He spent his entire professional playing career with Manchester United, for whom he
                        scored over 150 goals in more than 700 appearances between 1993 and 2013. His first managerial
                        position was at Oldham Athletic, for 31 days in February and March 2019.
                        <span class="dots" id="dots-paul">...</span>
                        <span class="more" id="more-paul">
                           <br><br>
                           Scholes came through the Manchester United youth academy as one of Fergie's Fledglings (a
                           group
                           of players recruited by Manchester United under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson). Scholes
                           made his full debut for Manchester United in the 1994–95 season. He went on to make 718
                           appearances for United, the third-highest number of appearances by any player for the club.
                           Scholes announced his retirement from playing in May 2011 and was appointed as a coach at
                           Manchester United. However, he returned to playing in January 2012, and went on to play one
                           more
                           season for the club before retiring again in May 2013. With United, Scholes won 25
                           trophies including 11 Premier League titles (more than any other English player) and two
                           Champions League titles.
                           <br><br>
                           Scholes represented the England national team from 1997 to 2004, gaining 66 caps and
                           participating in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, as well as the UEFA Euro 2000 and Euro 2004
                           tournaments. Scholes announced his retirement from international football in August 2004,
                           citing
                           his family life and his club career with Manchester United as being more important.
                           <br><br>
                           Regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, over his career Scholes has
                           received
                           praise from other managers and players, including Xavi, who said in 2014 that Scholes was
                           "the
                           best central midfielder" he had seen in the previous 15 to 20 years, describing him as "a
                           spectacular player who has everything. He can play the final pass, he can score, he is
                           strong,
                           he never gets knocked off the ball and he doesn’t give possession away." Pelé said: "If he
                           was playing with me, I would have scored so many more." Thierry Henry cited Scholes as the
                           greatest player in Premier League history.

                           Rooney joined the Everton youth team at the age of 9, and made his professional debut for the
                           club in 2002 at the age of 16. He spent two seasons at the Merseyside club, before moving to
                           Manchester United for £25.6 million in the 2004 summer transfer window. He won 16 trophies
                           with
                           the club, including five Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League in
                           2008. He scored 253 goals for United in all competitions to make him their top goalscorer
                           of all time, with 183 Premier League goals being the most scored by a player for any single
                           club. Rooney's 208 Premier League goals make him the Premier League's second top scorer of
                           all
                           time behind only Alan Shearer. He also has the third-highest number of assists in the Premier
                           League, with 103.

                           Rooney made his senior international debut for England in February 2003 aged 17, becoming the
                           youngest player to represent England (a record since broken by Theo Walcott) and he is
                           England's
                           youngest ever goalscorer. He played at UEFA Euro 2004 and scored four goals, briefly becoming
                           the youngest goalscorer in the history of the European Championship. Rooney has since
                           featured
                           at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 World Cups and was widely regarded as his country's best
                           player. He has won the England Player of the Year award four times, in 2008, 2009, 2014
                           and 2015. With 53 goals in 120 international caps, Rooney is England's all-time record
                           goalscorer and second most-capped player, behind Peter Shilton. Along with David Beckham,
                           Rooney
                           is the most red-carded player for England, having been sent off twice.
                           <br><br>
                           In 2009–10, Rooney was awarded the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of
                           the
                           Year. He won the Premier League Player of the Month award five times, a record only bettered
                           by
                           Steven Gerrard and Harry Kane. His displays at the start of the decade saw him come fifth in
                           the
                           vote for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or and he was named in the FIFA World XI for 2011. Rooney has
                           won the Goal of the Season award by the BBC's Match of the Day poll on three occasions, with
                           his
                           bicycle kick against city rivals Manchester City winning the Premier League Goal of the 20
                           Seasons award.

                     <P>
                        George Best was a Northern Irish professional footballer who
                        played as a winger, spending most of his career at Manchester United. He is universally regarded
                        as one of the greatest players of all time. A highly skilful winger, considered by several
                        pundits to be one of the greatest dribblers in the history of the sport, Best received plaudits
                        for his playing style, which combined pace, skill, balance, feints, two-footedness, goalscoring
                        and the ability to get past defenders.

                        <span class="more" id="more-george">
                           <br><br>
                           With his good looks and playboy lifestyle, Best became one of the first media celebrity
                           footballers, earning the nickname "Fifth Beatle" in 1966, but his extravagant life style led
                           to various personal problems, most notably alcoholism, which he suffered from for the rest of
                           his life. These issues affected him on and off the field, often causing controversy. Although
                           conscious of his problems, he was publicly not contrite about them; he said of his career: "I
                           spent a lot of money on booze, birds [women] and fast cars – the rest I just squandered".
                           After football, he spent some time as a football analyst, but his financial and health
                           problems
                           continued into his retirement. He died in 2005, age 59, due to complications from the
                           immunosuppressive drugs he needed to take after a liver transplant in 2002.
